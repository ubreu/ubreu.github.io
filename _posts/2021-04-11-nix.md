[Nix][nix] is a functional package manager that's designed to help with dependency management in your development environment.
Nix treats packages like values in functional programming languages such as Haskell â€” they never change after they have been built.
Each version of a package is stored under a unique identifier (hash) in a special location: the Nix store.
This allows us to have multiple versions or variants of a package installed at the same time.

I use it for all projects - whether I am just prototyping, testing a framework or developing a large solution.

## Prerequisites

1. [Install nix][install-nix].
2. [Install direnv][direnv].

Whenever I start a new project I perform the following steps:

## Setup sources using [niv][niv]

```sh
# install niv if using it for the first time:
nix-shell -p niv

# initialize project source
niv init
```

## Add shell.nix

A sample shell.nix being used for this blog:

```nix
let
  sources = import ./nix/sources.nix;
  pkgs = import sources.nixpkgs { };
in with pkgs;

mkShell {
  buildInputs = [
    jekyll
  ];
}
```

## Setup direnv configuration

Add a top-level file called .envrc with the following contents:

```sh
use_nix
```

Allow direnv to run in the current directory:

```sh
direnv allow
```

Now we are all set and ready to go:

```sh
jekyll -v
jekyll 4.0.0
```
